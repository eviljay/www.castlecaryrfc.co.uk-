	<p>The Club's adopted emblem is the Castle Cary Round House.</p>  
	<p>One of only four in the UK, it was built in 1779 by Mr W.M. Clark for &pound;23 (from local charities) as a temporary prison or lock-up. It is 7ft in diameter and 10ft high with two iron grilles for ventilation.</p>
	<p>In 1894 it was repaired as a result of a 1/- subscription and in 1922 the Lord of the Manor, Sir Henry Hoare Bart, JP, presented it to the Parish Council.</p>
	<p>It is situated at Bailey Hill, Castle Cary.</p>
