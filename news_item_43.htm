                    <h2>Club captain: Paul Hoggett</h2>
                    <p>Preparation for the season has gone well with good numbers at pre-season training. Tough warm-up matches in Cary's inaugural 15-a-side tournament and the Butleigh 7s tournament have all helped. Two wins and two losses for the first team has shown the need to raise our game.</p>
                    <p>We worked extremely hard last season to earn the right to play in these types of games and to test ourselves. We must now work even harder to maintain our status in this league and to achieve the finish we all aspire to.
                    <p>Finally, we need more players! So players past, present and future, get your boots back on, bring a friend and get them to bring their friends. Our fine club is growing from strength to strength under the new coaching team and I believe there is a real sense that we are moving forward, but we are a little short of numbers. When we have a few missing with injuries, etc. we are struggling to field full strength sides with a solid bench for both sides. So please, a real effort from everyone to get more players into the Club would keep us moving in the right direction.</p>

                    <p>We're well into the season and the teams are doing well, but they do need your support, so come down and join us on the touchline! As you will see from this edition of the newsletter, we have some fantastic plans and together we will achieve them, but again your support is vital, so if you can help in any way, then let us know.</p>
                    <p>I would like to take this opportunity to say <em>au revoir</em> but not goodbye to Neville Brook, who after many many years of playing for our club, he has decided to hang up his boots. Neville has been a loyal player and he will be missed on the field; we need to make sure hes still with us off the field!</p>

                    <h2>Rugby Manager: Andy Gibbens</h2>
                    <p>Senior rugby has started well given the warm conditions and the firm grounds. Angus Roberts tops the try-scoring list followed by Will Ennis. Robbie Blackburn's kicking duties have him as top point scorer. Did everyone notice in RB's absence the skipper slotted 5 from 8 v Wells 2nd? Thursday nights are going well and the level of fitness attained by the players is much improved.</p>

                    <h2>Junior update: Karen Travers &amp; Steve Armson</h2>
                    <p>What a great start to the new season. As you may have noticed, we have quite a few new members, so keep spreading the good word about what a great club we are and what a good set-up we have!</p>
                    <p>We will continue to raise funds for the Junior section by having some sort of 'sale' every Sunday: anything  ranging from raffles, cakes, tombolas and second-hand books, so if you have any books or unwanted gifts you wish to donate, then bring them down to the Club. We will also be having a 'rags' collection soon, again to raise money, so bring us down all your cast-off clothing and we'll sell it on. More details to follow.</p>
                    <p>We wish to thank all the parents who volunteered to help out with various things ranging from kitchen duties to admininstration and fundraising. If you want to help out, rather than leave it to the same few people (and it's getting more and more demanding as we grow), then please come and talk to Karen or Viv.</p>
                    <p>We have also introduced parent reps for each age group to help with the communication. Their names are listed below, so if you dont know them, make a point of seeking them out:<br>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Under 6s: Emma Abbott, Andrew and Fiona Burrows</li>
                    <li>Under 7s: Simon Hawksley, Tracey Heath</li>
                    <li>Under 8s: Sarah Willoughby, Maria Douglas</li>
                    <li>Under 9s: Caroline Suri, Andy Davis</li>
                    <li>Under 10s: Two volunteers needed</li>
                    <li>Under 11s: Tim Ellis, Michelle Crabb</li>
                    <li>Under 12s: Michelle Crabb, one volunteer needed</li>
                    <li>Under 13s: Becky Thurgood, one volunteer needed</li>
                    <li>Development Squad: Tudor Thomas, one volunteer needed</li>
                    </ul>
                    Please try and help out where there are volunteers needed.</p>

                    <p>Finally, the children took part in the Castle Cary and Wincanton carnivals in October. We were a great success and our <em>Dennis the Menace</em> theme was well received by the crowds. Many thanks to all the parents and children who helped out with this event and particular thanks to Maria Douglas, who produced some fantastic banners for us, and Michelle Crabb, who made Dennis's dog, Gnasher &mdash; he was a big hit with everyone!</p>
                    <p>Thanks to Keith Richardson for the photo, showing the Under 14s' Lester, Josh, George and Nick at Wincanton Carnival.</p>

However, please bring your own dog pooh bags and clean up any mess your pooch may deposit on our fields. It really isn't good for any of our players or members to come into contact with it. Thank you!</p>
